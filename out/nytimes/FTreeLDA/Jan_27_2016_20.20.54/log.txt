Running LDA inference using FTreeLDA
For dataset nytimes
For number of iterations 200
For number of topics 1000
Using 20 sampler threads and 2 updater threads on bros
Running LDA inference using FTreeLDA
Now randomly initialising model variables for training
We will perform a test on a heldout set.
