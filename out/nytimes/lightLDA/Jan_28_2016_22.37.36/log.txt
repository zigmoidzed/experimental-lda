Running LDA inference using lightLDA
For dataset nytimes
For number of iterations 1000
For number of topics 1000
Using 24 sampler threads and 8 updater threads on bros
Running LDA inference using lightLDA
Now randomly initialising model variables for training
We will perform a test on a heldout set.
